# Discriminative Reranker for a Probabilistic Parser

This repository contains an implementation of a parsing reranker trained with two learning algorithms: __Primal SVM__ and __Perceptron.__ The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each sentence, with associated log probabilities that define the initial ranking of these parses. A second model attempts to improve on this initial ranking, using additional features extracted from the trees in the training set. (Assignment for Algorithms for NLP course @CMU (11-711))
